</p>

<p>
Since a young age, Rachel had seemingly separate passions for fashion, business, and law. As she got older, Rachel became inspired by the legal world. Rachel realized how the fashion and business industries, which she loved to learn from, were heavily affected by the legal world. By learning how law related to fashion and business, Rachel became passionate about legal findings in both worldsâ€™ industries. As a recently admitted attorney, Rachel, wanted to bring her intersecting passions to one place to become a valid source for fashion, business, and law.
Curated through the lens of a young practicing lawyer, here is TLR.
