    <h3>Passion for Law</h3>
   
        <p>
            I have always been interested in law. As a young girl, I knew one day I wanted to slip on some designer heels and fight for justice. Along the way, I realized I loved fashion. Now, no matter whether my heads are in the books or I am in a courtroom, I always love to spice up my look with my favorite designers and trends. Not only do I love practicing law with fashion, but I enjoy discerning legal cases that involve fashion and business. These three areas meet at harmony and have become three industries that I can never see apart anymore as I have seen them intersect so many times.

    <h3> Blog Post: Luxury or Resale? The Real Real Brings Antitrust Concerns 
        in Counterclaim to Chanel Lawsuit
    </h3>

        <p>
            I have always been interested in law. As a young girl, I knew one day I wanted to slip on some designer heels and fight for justice. Along the way, I realized I loved fashion. Now, no matter whether my heads are in the books or I am in a courtroom, I always love to spice up my look with my favorite designers and trends. Not only do I love practicing law with fashion, but I enjoy discerning legal cases that involve fashion and business. These three areas meet at harmony and have become three industries that I can never see apart anymore as I have seen them intersect so many times.

        </p>

        <p>The Real Real’s counterclaim has some solid footing. Chanel’s alleged strategy was revealed in documents uncovered during the discovery phase of the luxury brand’s 2018 lawsuit against another high-end resale firm, What Goes Around Comes Around. Chanel has targeted The RealReal and What Goes Around Comes Around because of the high number of products bearing the Chanel label offered by the site.
        </p>
        <p>Notably, Chanel did not name Farfetch in any of its resale lawsuits. In fact, Chanel invested in Farfetch in 2018. Karen Dunn, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, representing The RealReal, stated that “Chanel had become an investor in Farfetch, and then decided not to pursue legal action against Farfetch for the same conduct it claims is illegal when The RealReal does it.” She continued, “After Chanel’s investment in Farfetch came to light, The RealReal moved very quickly to bring antitrust claims against Chanel and the internal documents that have come out since then support our claims.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Dunn posits that “Chanel was working to disadvantage and shut down the market for secondary products,” which is evidenced by the fact that The RealReal would make business agreements with retailers like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue, there would be ads scheduled to run in various publications, and lo and behold, the retail or media partner would back out because of Chanel’s interference.” Dunn said Chanel’s interference in The RealReal’s partnerships with the retailers took the form of “Chanel threatening to pull its products from their stores if they didn’t amend their partnerships with The RealReal to prohibit consignment of Chanel products or the purchase of Chanel products with store gift cards earned as part of a The RealReal promotion.”
        </p>
<p>Founder and CEO of The Real Real, Julie Wainwright, suspected Chanel’s motivation was to shut down the secondary market for their products. She said, “Now there's direct evidence of that. It’s disappointing. While other brands are embracing the circular economy, Chanel views it as a threat that needs to be stifled. We’re proud to provide consumers with a safe platform to buy and sell luxury goods and help make fashion more sustainable.” Conversely, Chanel maintains that it brought its action against The RealReal in order to protect consumers from false advertising and the sale of counterfeit handbags on The RealReal website.” To that end, in January 2016 Chanel issued guidelines to other sellers that include: “Stop using claims such as ‘100% authentic’, ‘we guarantee authenticity’ or similar claims as they pertain to Chanel products, because only Chanel can guarantee the authenticity of its products.”
</p>
<p>As the case proceeds, we will keep you posted on its movements. In the meantime, its wise to wonder how the outcome of the case may affect resale of designer brands, such as Chanel, and the impact it may have on sustainability.
