 <p>
    I am a political science major interested in <strong>international law</strong> and <strong>human rights</strong> law. I am minoring in information management and technology.
    At Syracuse University I have been Secretary of Kappa Kappa Gamma, a TA for a First-Year SEM class, and volunteered at RISE Syracuse.
    Last summer, I interned for Governor Andrew Cuomo and then for New York State Senator Jeremy Cooney this past fall. I have earned a Dean’s List recognition every semester so far.

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
    Outside of work, I love to spend time drawing, painting, reading fiction, or watching more fast-paced TV shows. One of my favorite TV shows is Mad Men and my favorite book is The Great Gatsby.
    When I’m at home, I work at a local coffee shop as a barista. 
    This year, one of my largest goals is to get into one of my top law schools.
