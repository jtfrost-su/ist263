I am a political science major interested in international law and human rights law. At Syracuse University I have been Secretary of Kappa Kappa Gamma, a TA for a First-Year SEM class, and volunteered at RISE Syracuse. Last summer, I interned for Governor Andrew Cuomo and then for New York State Senator Jeremy Cooney this past fall. I have earned a Dean’s List recognition every semester thus far. Outside of work, I love to spend time drawing, painting, reading fiction, or watching more fast-paced TV shows. One of my favorite TV shows is Mad Men and my favorite book is The Great Gatsby. When I’m at home, I work at a local coffee shop as a barista. This year, one of my biggest goals is to gain admittance into law school.
